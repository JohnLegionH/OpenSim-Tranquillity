// Jolt implementation of IPhysicsBackend.
//
// ============================ READ THIS FIRST ============================
// Jolt binding: JoltPhysicsSharp 2.18.6 (newest still shipping lib/net8.0/),
// single precision (Foundation.Init(false); the native is loaded by JoltNative). The Jolt calls below
// are the 2.18.6 surface, checked by reflection against the shipped assembly.
//
// The parts worth reading carefully are the ones that are easy to get wrong and
// expensive to discover later:
//   - broad phase / object layer filtering  (BroadPhase region + Initialize)
//   - DontActivate on insert                (CreateBody)
//   - ScaledShape for prim resize           (CreateScaledShape)
//   - contact ring buffer                   (JoltContactListener)
//   - CharacterVirtual stepping order       (Step)

        // first region's settings (ThreadCount / DeterministicMode) under s_foundationGate, then shared.
        //
        // ONE PHYSICS UPDATE PER POOL. A JobSystemThreadPool's queue is a fixed ring of 1024 slots
        // (JobSystemThreadPool.h:86) shared by every Update on the pool; its head is the minimum of the workers'
        // heads, a worker advances its own head only after its running job returns, and QueueJobInternal sleeps
        // 100 us and retries forever while the ring is full (JobSystemThreadPool.cpp 152-190). So a worker whose
        // job queues a follow-on job into a full ring waits on its own head. Concurrent Updates add their queue
        // traffic together - four regions x 300 boxes wedged every time, whatever maxJobs was. One Update at a
        // time is the configuration Jolt is built and tested for, so each pool admits ONE Update through its gate
        // and the process scales by running [Jolt] JobPools pools. Step takes the gate BEFORE this region's
