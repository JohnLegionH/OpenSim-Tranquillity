// Finds, checks and loads the joltc native for the platform the process runs on.
//
// The native comes from the JoltPhysics.Native package that JoltPhysicsSharp depends on: a build puts the package's
// files under runtimes/<rid>/native/ next to the application's assemblies (a build or publish for one runtime
// identifier puts the file for that platform in the output folder itself). This class picks the file for the running
// platform, checks its SHA-256 against the record below, loads it by full path, and hands that one handle to every
// P/Invoke into "joltc":
//   - JoltPhysicsSharp's own calls, through the binding's JoltApi.JoltDllImporterResolver hook, which its
//     resolver asks before it probes for a joltc of its own (JoltApi.cs in JoltPhysicsSharp at the commit
//     behind 2.19.1). The hook is on an internal class, so it is reached by reflection; without it the
//     binding would load whichever joltc its own probing finds, so a missing hook is an error.
//   - this assembly's own DllImport("joltc") calls (JoltPhysicsBackend), through SetDllImportResolver.
// The load happens once per process; every region and every backend shares it.
//
// The record also says whether a build is safe for more than one job pool. The stock joltc gives every physics system
// one process-wide TempAllocator, so two physics updates at once on two pools stop the process; on it the backend runs
// one pool whatever [Jolt] JobPools asks (JoltPhysicsBackend.ResolveJobPools). This project's patched build
// (native/joltc/README.md) gives each system its own allocator; an operator who puts it in place of the stock file
// gets the pools [Jolt] JobPools asks for.
