# Which script engine runs a script

A region can load several script engines (YEngine, Phlox, SLua). When a script starts, the region picks
the engine in this order and stops at the first step that gives an answer:

0. **The viewer's compile target.** A script saved from a viewer's script editor with the compiler "Lua" (`luau`)
   or "LSL on Lua" (`lsl-luau`) carries that choice with its item, and the SLua engine takes it ahead of the
   first line, as described under "The viewer's compile target" below. Saved state for the item and asset still
   places a script that already runs on another engine. A script with no such choice skips this step.
1. **The first line.** `//<engine>:<language>` names an engine loaded in the region: its engine name
   (`InWorldz.Phlox`, `YEngine`, `SLua`) or a header alias the engine lists (`//Phlox:` for Phlox). Names are
   compared as written.
2. **Saved state.** The engine that holds saved state for the script's item and asset keeps it, the
   `DefaultScriptEngine` first. A running script therefore stays on its engine across a restart, whatever the
   settings below say. Editing a script gives it a new asset and so no saved state.
3. **A claim.** A script with source is offered to each engine that can claim scripts, in the order the engines
   are loaded; the first to say yes gets it. The SLua engine claims:
   - a script whose first line is `--!slua`, whenever the engine is enabled and running;
   - every script that has no engine header, when `ClaimHeaderlessScripts = true` in the `[SLua]` section (default
     `false`). Such a script runs as LSL, or as SLua when its text begins with `--`.
4. **The default.** `[Startup] DefaultScriptEngine`.

With the SLua engine off (`[SLua] Enabled` unset or false) steps 1, 2 and 4 are all that happen, and a
`--!slua` script runs where it did before.

An engine that is not a script-selection participant is unaffected: it is chosen by name, by saved state or as
the default.

## The viewer's compile target

Second Life's script editor has a compiler list: LSL Legacy (`lsl2`), LSL on Mono (`mono`), LSL on Lua
(`lsl-luau`) and Lua (`luau`). It sends the choice as the `target` field of the script upload capabilities
(`UpdateScriptTask` for a script in an object, `UpdateScriptAgent` for one in the avatar's inventory).

- `luau` and `lsl-luau` are kept with the script item, in the low byte of its flags (where Second Life keeps the
  script subtype: 1 for Lua), so no database column is added and the choice survives a failed compile. The SLua
  engine compiles the script as the language the choice names (Lua, or LSL on the Luau virtual machine), whatever
  its first line says; a first line naming another engine is ignored for that script.
- `mono` and `lsl2` make no explicit choice. They clear an earlier `luau` or `lsl-luau`, and the first line, a
  claim and the default decide as described above, so a viewer that only offers `mono` and `lsl2` behaves as before.
  A save that sends no `target` leaves the stored choice as it was.
- The choice is honoured only while the SLua engine is enabled and running; otherwise the script goes where the
  first line, saved state and the default put it, and the stored choice waits.
- When the editor asks whether a script is running (`GetScriptRunning`), the reply (`ScriptRunningReply`) carries
  `Mono`, `Luau` and `LuauLanguage` as the editor reads them, so its compiler list shows the saved choice. The
  SLua engine answers for the scripts it runs; for a script without a stored choice it reports the language the
  script was compiled as.

The `LuaScriptsEnabled` entry of the `SimulatorFeatures` capability, which a viewer needs before it enables the
Lua entries of its compiler list, is not set by the region.
