/*
 * Concurrency/regression tests for room selection (JanusAudioBridge).
 *
 * Live defect: three near-simultaneous ProvisionVoiceAccountRequests from one agent
 * (all region/estate room, parcel -999) raced. Because the AudioBridge (and its room
 * cache) was per viewer session, nothing coalesced the concurrent Janus room creates;
 * one create came back non-486 ("room selection failed") while the retry succeeded.
 *
 * Part 1 (CreateWithRecheck): an inconclusive first create is re-attempted once, so a
 *   cross-process create that won the race resolves to 486 -> reuse.
 * Part 2 (SelectRoomCoalesced): a process-wide per-room lock + existence hint collapse
 *   concurrent same-process creates of one room number to a single Janus create.
 *
 * Both helpers are Func-based (no Janus transport) so they unit-test per the house
 * pattern. Each test uses a distinct room number because the coalescing state is static
 * (process-wide by design).
