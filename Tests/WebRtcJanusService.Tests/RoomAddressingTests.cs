/*
 * Slice 0.8c2 (ledger O-92): an agent is addressed at the room it is IN, and never at a guessed one.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. Until this slice the sim had one rule for an agent with no AgentRoomTable record: address it at the
 * region's estate-channel room. That number is a real, live room in every region, so the "fallback" was not inert -
 * on a parcel with its own voice channel it wrote that agent's live exclusion and mute state into the WRONG room, and
 * on an empty region it created policy for a room no viewer had provisioned. It also looked healthy: the send
 * succeeded, the counters called it a fallback, and the operator saw a number.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE PINS (ruling B). The resolver answers in this order, and only this order:
 *   1. the agent's room RECORD, if it has one;
 *   2. else the room ConnectorRoomResolver's logic says an avatar at that agent's current position would be
 *      provisioned into - its parcel's room, which on an estate-channel parcel IS the estate number;
 *   3. else nothing: the agent is OMITTED from every batch, every column and every heartbeat entry, and counted.
 * The estate number is never an address merely because it is the default. Where it is the RESOLVED number - an
 * estate-channel parcel, which is the common case - every byte is exactly what it was before this slice, which is
 * why the knob-off goldens are untouched (O2 below proves the knob-ON half the goldens do not cover).
 *
 * The rig composes the resolver exactly as VoiceVisibilityService does (record, else parcel, else null); the sim-side
 * halves of that composition are proven where they live - the record table by AgentRoomTableTests, the parcel number
 * by ConnectorRoomResolverTests and FeederWorldFromSceneTests.
