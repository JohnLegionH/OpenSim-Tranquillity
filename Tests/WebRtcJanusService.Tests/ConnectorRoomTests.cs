/*
 * Slice 0.8c (ledger O-93, and the connector half of O-92): a connector's room is resolved the way an avatar's is,
 * the sim makes sure it exists, and an unknown_room retry backs off.
 *
 * T4 lives here first, because it is the one that measures the defect: with the 0.8 build a listener whose re-arm
 * request never clears is re-armed EVERY tick, so a room that stays unknown is hammered at tick rate. The other
 * cases live in ConnectorRoomResolverTests / the endpoint tests; this file is the authority-level behaviour.
