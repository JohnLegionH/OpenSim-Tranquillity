/// The 90 degree turn of the camera under the InWorldz behaviour, beside the default's (VehicleMouselookHuntingTests: an
/// overshoot of 11 to 16 degrees and the heading within half a degree by 12 s). A car facing east, MOUSELOOK_STEER, the
/// driver's camera looking north, its angular motor <0,0,1.5> held for 16 s, on the real engine. Under InWorldz the turn is
/// a share of that motor, shaped by (e^x - 1) / (e - 1), which is whole from 30 degrees off the heading and dies away
/// toward the dead zone, so the car turns at the full rate until it is within 30 degrees and then slows. Serial with the
/// other native tests.
