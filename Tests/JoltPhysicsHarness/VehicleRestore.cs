// The ways the simulator hands a saved vehicle back to the physics engine, replayed at the PhysicsActor surface.
//
// The record. A script's llSetVehicleType, llSetVehicle*Param and llSetVehicleFlags / llRemoveVehicleFlags reach
// SceneObjectPart.SetVehicleType / SetVehicleFloatParam / SetVehicleVectorParam / SetVehicleRotationParam /
// SetVehicleFlags. Each updates the part's SOPVehicle (its VehicleData) and forwards the same call to the root's actor.
// That SOPVehicle is what the simulator keeps: SOPVehicle.ToXml2 inside the object's XML in inventory, in a region
// crossing and in an attachment, and as the Vehicle column of the region's database.
//
// The routes back. Each ends in SceneObjectPart.AddToPhysics, which builds a new actor and, for a root with a record,
// calls SOPVehicle.SetVehicle(actor), i.e. PhysicsActor.SetVehicle(VehicleData):
// - rez from inventory: the object is read from its XML and added (SceneGraph.AddSceneObject, then
//   SceneObjectGroup.AttachToScene, then ApplyPhysics);
// - region start: each object is loaded from the database (Scene.LoadPrimsFromStorage, AddRestoredSceneObject) and
//   added the same way, before the region's first physics step;
// - a copy: SceneObjectGroup.Copy clones each part (MemberwiseClone, so the copy shares the original's SOPVehicle) and
//   calls ApplyPhysics on it with building on, then turns building off on the root;
// - a region crossing: the object arrives as XML, or as such a copy within one simulator (Scene.IncomingCreateObject,
//   AddSceneObject, AddRestoredSceneObject), and is added the same way;
// - an attachment taken off and dropped: AttachmentsModule.DetachSingleAttachmentToGround clears the attachment and
//   calls ApplyPhysics (an attachment has no actor while worn);
// - physics switched off and on, by llSetStatus or the build tool (both reach SceneObjectPart.UpdatePrimFlags): a solid
//   prim keeps its actor, which is only made non-physical and physical again (DoPhysicsPropertyUpdate); no vehicle call
//   is made. A phantom prim loses its actor when physics goes off (RemoveFromPhysics) and is built anew by AddToPhysics
//   when it comes back on.
