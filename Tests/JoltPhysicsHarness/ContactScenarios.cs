// Resting-contact scenarios: what a box's collision events do while it rests on something and falls asleep, and when it
// is thrown off again; and that stacked and dropped boxes come to rest.
//
// Second Life documents (wiki.secondlife.com): collision_start is "Triggered when task starts colliding with another
// task", collision "while task is colliding with another task" and collision_end "when task stops colliding with
// another task"; "A collision with a physical object or avatar resting on object does not continuously trigger
// collisions but for a few times, unless there is movement" (the collision event). land_collision_start, land_collision
// and land_collision_end are the same for the land. A volume detector raises "collision_start and collision_end but not
// collision() events".
//
// Each box here is given the prim defaults the scene gives a new prim (wood: friction 0.6, restitution 0.5;
// SceneObjectPart.AddToPhysics), is let fall onto what it rests on, and is left long enough to fall asleep; the resting
// scenarios then throw it off at LiftAt with an impulse, as llApplyImpulse would, which wakes it.
