// Shot scenarios: a small physical ball shot fast at something it must not pass through (a thin fixed wall, a physical
// box resting on the ground, the ground itself), and at things it must pass through (a volume-detect slab, a physical
// phantom box). The ball's diameter and speed come from the options (--ball, --shot-speed), so one scenario covers a
// whole sweep. A run's summary has tunneled = 1 when the ball went through what it was shot at.
//
// The ball is added at the start and given its speed one heartbeat later, as a script's llSetVelocity reaches a body
// that has just gone physical (the region's load heartbeat keeps no horizontal velocity; JoltPrim.Velocity).
