/*
 * Phase 0 slice 0.4 (design §11.5): the arming state the sim believed current for a room, so a capability minted
 * before an epoch change does not survive one.
 *
 * Why a process-wide table rather than a reference: the authority (VisAuthority) lives in the region module with
 * the visibility feeder, while the join that carries the capability is performed by the Janus service in another
 * assembly, and neither references the other. The visibility service PUBLISHES each room's (epoch, generation) as
 * it arms, and the join seam RESOLVES it. An unpublished room resolves to (NoEpoch, 0), which is exactly what a
 * sim with arming off mints and what a mixer with no authority expects.
 *
 * This holds no secrets: an epoch and a generation are both reported by the mixer's admin API already.
