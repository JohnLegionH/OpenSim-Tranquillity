/*
 * O-72: a per-(agent, region) negative cache for refused voice provisions.
 *
 * The LL/Firestorm viewer treats every non-2xx provision answer except 401/409 as SESSION_EXIT and
 * re-provisions immediately, with no backoff (llvoicewebrtc.cpp :2913-2927, :3182-3201) - and a 200 whose
 * body is a failure map lands in the same place. Live 2026-09-13 that was ~2 Hz for as long as a provision
 * was refused or the mixer was down. The sim cannot stop the retries, so it makes them cheap and quiet:
 * after a refusal, identical attempts within the window get the SAME answer without re-running the checks
 * or touching Janus, and the caller logs at most one line per (agent, region) per window.
 *
 * Pure and clock-injectable so it unit-tests; the region module and the service module each hold one.
