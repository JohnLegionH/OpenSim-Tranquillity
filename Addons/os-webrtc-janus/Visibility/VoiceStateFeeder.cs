/*
 * VoiceStateFeeder - produces the per-listener visibility matrix and a delta stream.
 *
 * Scene-free: it reads IFeederWorld, so it unit-tests without a Scene. The region module owns
 * one per region, forwards sim events into the On* / Invalidate hooks, and drives Tick() on a
 * ~250ms timer. One code path (Build -> Diff) => one matrix => one source of truth.
 *
 * The tick ALWAYS rebuilds, because child agents get no crossing event and must be re-derived
 * from position every tick (baseline 2.1). Parcel/estate events therefore need only mark the
 * feeder invalidated so the owner can choose to tick early for low latency; correctness does
 * not depend on them, since Build reads live world state each tick.
 *
 * Hardening: rule derivation can touch live sim state via the ParcelView ban/restrict delegates
 * (and, in production, an enumerating SnapshotAgents), so Tick() and the initial build catch and
 * report any derivation exception and keep the last good matrix - a bad tick must not kill the
 * timer; the next tick re-derives. Debug builds also assert the matrix is only ever mutated on a
 * single tick thread.
