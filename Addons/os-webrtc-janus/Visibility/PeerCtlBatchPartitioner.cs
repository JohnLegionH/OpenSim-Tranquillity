/*
 * Pure partitioner for per-room peer_ctl_batch emission (per-room-visibility-emission-design-brief.md
 * §8 step S3a; policy from §7 OQ2, OQ4 and "Resolved: one policy for a missing room record").
 *
 * Takes the ROOM-LESS listener -> excluded-sources map the orchestrator produces, a room resolver
 * and the estate room, and splits it into one map per mixer room. Each result map is exactly what
 * PeerCtlBatchSerializer.BuildRequest already accepts, so the sink (S3b) loops the result and stamps
 * one room per request. Sibling of that serializer: dependency-free beyond OpenMetaverse - no Scene,
 * no Janus, no OSD, no I/O - and directly unit-testable.
 *
 * ONE policy for a missing record, both roles: roomOf(agent) = record ?? estateRoom. A source with
 * no record is NOT dropped; it is an estate-room source, kept for estate-room listeners and filtered
 * out for per-parcel listeners. The asymmetry OQ2 first drafted (drop unrecorded sources) is
 * superseded: under connector-topology skew NOBODY has a record, and dropping sources while
 * defaulting listeners would empty every column and silently collapse estate enforcement region-wide.
 * Symmetric fallback makes that state today's behaviour byte-for-byte - which is what the fast path
 * below returns literally, the same map instance, unfiltered.
 *
 * Same-room filtering (OQ2(a)): a listener's column keeps only the sources in the LISTENER's room.
 * A cross-room source is inert at the mixer (room membership already prevents it being heard), so
 * this is lossless, and it puts a per-room column under SLV_MAX_MIX - 1 = 109 BY CONSTRUCTION rather
 * than under a guard that has to be maintained.
 *
 * A listener whose column filters down to nothing KEEPS ITS KEY. An empty source array is a
 * meaningful "clear this listener" on a Replace (the serializer preserves it deliberately), so
 * dropping the key would silently skip the clear.
