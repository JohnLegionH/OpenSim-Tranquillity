/*
 * Transport seam for the peer_ctl_batch feed (mixer-feed-protocol.md §3.3). Backend-neutral: the
 * orchestrator passes a typed op + per-listener exclusion sets; the implementation serializes,
 * STAMPS THE ROOM, wraps the Janus admin envelope, and sends. The orchestrator stays room-agnostic
 * and Janus-agnostic — this interface is the only thing it knows about the transport.
 *
 * Lives in Visibility so both the orchestrator (WebRtcVoiceRegionModule) and the prod
 * implementation (Janus-side, WebRtcVoiceServiceModule) can reference it without either referencing
 * the other, and without touching WebRtcVoice.dll.
