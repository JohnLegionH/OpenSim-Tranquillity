/*
 * Janus-side implementation of IPeerCtlBatchSink (Phase 3a option C). Partitions each send by the
 * room its listeners are actually in and sends one peer_ctl_batch per room via JanusAdminClient
 * (Admin API message_plugin, admin_secret in the body). One instance per region; owns its
 * JanusAdminClient (and its HttpClient) for its lifetime.
 *
 * Per-room emission (per-room-visibility-emission-design-brief.md §8 step S3b). Until S3b the sink
 * stamped ONE room on every batch - the estate room - so exclusions for agents in per-parcel rooms
 * were addressed to a room those agents are not in and were silently dropped at the mixer. Now:
 *   - PeerCtlBatchPartitioner (S3a) splits the map by roomOf(listener), keeping for each listener
 *     only the sources in that same room (inert cross-room sources cost cap and nothing else);
 *   - one admin message goes to each room, issued in parallel under a small cap (OQ3);
 *   - the per-room results aggregate into ONE PeerCtlSendResult in §2a's severity order, so the
 *     sender's contract - and its consecutive-ProtocolError latch arithmetic - is unchanged.
 *
 * The constructor-computed estate room is now the FALLBACK: the room an agent with no record
 * resolves to, for listeners and sources alike (§7). It is still computed by the same
 * JanusAudioBridge.CalcRoomNumber the mixer uses, and still logged once at Info so it is
 * eyeball-comparable against handle_info - a wrong room is invisible on the wire.
 *
 * RoomOf is a SETTABLE property, not a ctor argument, because construction order forces it: the
 * region module builds this sink and then passes it INTO VoiceVisibilityService's constructor
 * (WebRtcVoiceRegionModule.cs:174-176), so the service - which owns the table - does not exist yet
 * when the sink does. The service assigns it in its own constructor, before Start(). While it is
 * null the partitioner reads it as "no agent has a record": every agent resolves to the fallback
 * room, one message goes out exactly as before S3b, and both fallback counters read the full
 * population, which is the loud version of that state rather than a crash on the send path.
