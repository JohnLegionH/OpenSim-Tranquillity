            //      removed accumulate), so any scan of it is an O(leak) cost that grows without
            //      bound and would drag every tick down as the process ages.
            //   2. So the filter is anchored to presences, not to sessions: we walk the live scene
            //      population (bounded by avatars actually here) and ask the index an O(1) question
            //      per presence. A ghost/stale index entry for an agent that has left the region
