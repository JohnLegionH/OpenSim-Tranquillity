 * the pure engine unit tests.

 * The parcel ban/restrict delegates read ACTUAL LandObject state on each call (this is where
 * VoiceStateFeeder.Tick's derivation hardening earns its keep — a live ParcelAccessList can

            //   1. We must NEVER iterate VoiceViewerSession.ViewerSessions to build the matrix: that
            //      registry leaks unbounded over process uptime (ghost sessions that never get
            //      removed accumulate), so any scan of it is an O(leak) cost that grows without
            //      bound and would drag every tick down as the process ages.
            //   2. So the filter is anchored to presences, not to sessions: we walk the live scene
            //      population (bounded by avatars actually here) and ask the index an O(1) question
            //      per presence. A ghost/stale index entry for an agent that has left the region
            //      matches no presence and contributes nothing, so the matrix stays bounded by
            //      population no matter how much the registry has leaked.
            // RegionId-scoped is deliberate: a child agent of an adjacent region shows up in this
