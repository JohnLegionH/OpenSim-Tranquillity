/*
 * P1.4a: "start conference" and the event-queue ChatterBoxSessionStartReply.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIX FOR THE POPUP JOHN HIT: "Unable to start a new chat session with Multi-person
 * chat. The session initialization is timed out." We answer "start conference" with 200 and no body
 * (O-107, ChatSessionRequestLogic.cs:167-175), so the viewer's session never initialises and
 * LLSessionTimeoutTimer fires that message. A body would not have helped: startConferenceCoro reads
 * NOTHING from the response (llimview.cpp:576-624) -- it only checks the status. The authoritative
 * id arrives on the EVENT QUEUE.
 *
 * ADHOC IS THE ONE TYPE THAT GENUINELY NEEDS THE RE-KEY. For a group the viewer slams the session id
 * to the group id, and for P2P it is the XOR, so both already agree with the server. For a
 * conference the viewer mints session_id.generate() (llimview.cpp:2542) -- a random id the server
 * has never seen -- and only adopts ours when the reply arrives:
 *     LLViewerChatterBoxSessionStartReply::post reads success / temp_session_id / session_id
 *         (llimview.cpp:4877-4886)
 *     -> processSessionInitializedReply re-keys mId2SessionMap, sets mSessionID and updates the
 *        voice channel id (:1705-1737, :1165-1177)
 *     -> and fires the QUEUED CALL if mStartCallOnInitialize (:1731-1734)
 * That last line is why this slice must come before ad-hoc voice: without the re-key the queued call
 * never starts.
 *
 * Modelled on GroupsMessagingModule.ChatterBoxSessionStartReplyViaCaps (:686-707), which has been
 * shipping this event for group chat for years. The module already knows how to send it -- the
 * ChatSessionOutcome.Reply path (WebRtcVoiceRegionModule.cs:1163-1185) -- so this arm only has to
 * produce the two ids and let the existing plumbing do the rest.
