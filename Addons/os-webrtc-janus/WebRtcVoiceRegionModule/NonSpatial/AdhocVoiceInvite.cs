/*
 * P1.4b: ad-hoc conference invitations -- the ring, the "invite" that adds someone to a call already
 * running, and the "decline invitation" that unwinds a pending one.
 *
 * HOW AN ADHOC RING DIFFERS FROM A GROUP RING, which is less than it looks:
 *   - the TARGET LIST is the session's own invited members (the `params` array from
 *     "start conference", plus anyone added later by "invite"), NOT a group roster. An ad-hoc
 *     conference has no roster; being invited is the whole of the membership.
 *   - `invitation_type` is CONFERENCE_SESSION = 1, not GROUP_CHAT_SESSION = 0 (llimview.cpp:119-125).
 *     That is what makes LLIMMgr::inviteToSession fall past the group branch -- `gAgent.isInGroup`
 *     is false for a conference id -- and land on "VoiceInviteAdHoc" (:4163-4168).
 *   - `session_id` is the AUTHORITATIVE conference id, the one the start reply re-keyed the viewer
 *     to. Sending the viewer's temp id would address a session the invitee has never heard of.
 * Everything else is shared: the same `voice` map, the same A2AInviteDelivery locally, the same
 * GroupVoiceRingTransport carrier cross-instance, the same online-only filter, and the initiator is
 * never rung.
