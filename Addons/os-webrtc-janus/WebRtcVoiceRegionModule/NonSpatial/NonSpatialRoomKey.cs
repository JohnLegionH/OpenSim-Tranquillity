/*
 * P1.1 item 3: the MEDIA ROOM identity, derived INDEPENDENTLY of the session identity.
 *
 * WHY NOT REUSE THE SESSION ID. The live A2A path sets ChannelUri => SessionId.ToString()
 * (A2ASessionRegistry.cs:66). That works, but it is OUR choice and not the viewer's contract:
 * P1-VERIFY established the viewer treats channel_uri as OPAQUE -- startAdHocSession takes it
 * straight out of channelInfo (llvoicewebrtc.cpp:1511) and posts it back verbatim as `channel`
 * (:3695). Binding room identity to session identity costs us the ability to re-room a live session
 * (a mixer move, a shard, a room rebuild) without changing the session the viewer is keyed to, so
 * this engine keeps them separate and makes the mapping explicit and one-way.
 *
 * DERIVATION
 *     RoomKey = "nsv1:" + tag + ":" + Uuid(SHA256(NS || 0x1F || gridId || 0x1F || tag || 0x1F || sessionId))
 *   where tag is p2p|adhoc|group and NS is the fixed namespace below. First 16 bytes of the digest
 *   become the UUID. Deterministic, so any instance on the grid derives the same key for the same
 *   session without coordination (item 7), and one-way, so the room key leaks no session identity.
 *
 * COLLISION ARGUMENT, in three layers, because only two of them are structural and the report must
 * not pretend otherwise:
 *
 *  (1) AGAINST LIVE A2A ROOMS -- STRUCTURAL, provable. A2A admission resolves a room by
 *      TryGetByChannel, which is `UUID.TryParse(channel)` and returns null when it fails
 *      (A2ASessionRegistry.cs:323-327). A room key minted here NEVER parses as a bare UUID: it
 *      always carries the "nsv1:<tag>:" prefix. So no conference room key can ever be mistaken for
 *      an A2A channel, and no A2A channel can ever equal a room key. This holds regardless of hash
 *      behaviour. (The reverse structural claim one might reach for -- that XOR-derived A2A ids have
 *      a fixed version nibble -- is FALSE here and was checked: LLUUID::generate runs the whole
 *      16 bytes through HBXXH128 (lluuid.cpp:850), so viewer ids carry no RFC-4122 version or
 *      variant bits at all. The prefix is what does the work.)
 *
 *  (2) AGAINST SPATIAL ROOMS -- STRUCTURAL. A spatial room is not keyed by any channel string: its
 *      number is hashed from (regionId, "local", parcelLocalID) and the "local" arm never reads
 *      pChannelID at all (JanusAudioBridge.cs:269-274). A room key is only ever presented under a
 *      non-"local" channel type, so it cannot enter that arm and cannot alias a parcel's room by
 *      construction of the hash inputs.
 *
 *  (3) AGAINST ANY ROOM AT THE MIXER'S NUMBER LAYER -- NOT eliminated, and I will not claim it is.
 *      The mixer's room identity is a positive int: FoldHashToRoom(djb2(...).GetHashCode())
 *      (JanusAudioBridge.cs:290-304), a ~2^31 space shared by spatial, A2A and anything added
 *      later. Two distinct inputs can fold to the same number; at ~46k concurrent rooms that is a
 *      coin flip. This risk PRE-DATES this engine and is shared equally by spatial and A2A today.
 *      What (1) and (2) buy is the removal of SYSTEMATIC aliasing -- distinct input tuples, no
 *      shared key space -- not the removal of birthday collisions. The residual is detectable
 *      rather than silent: the bridge stamps a roomDesc of regionId/channelType/parcel/channelID on
 *      create (:313) and treats "already exists" as success (:315), so an aliased room is a room
 *      whose description does not match what this session expects. ExpectedRoomDescription below
 *      gives the engine the string to compare when P1.x wires room allocation; closing the residual
 *      properly means widening the mixer's room number, which is its own slice and not this one.
