/*
 * P1.1: the NonSpatialVoiceSession engine -- the record types.
 *
 * A "non-spatial" voice session is any voice session whose room is NOT derived from region+parcel:
 * P2P, ADHOC (conference) and GROUP. The engine exists ALONGSIDE the live A2A path in this slice and
 * nothing is wired to a cap; P1.6 migrates A2A onto it.
 *
 * TWO IDENTITIES, DELIBERATELY DISTINCT (P1-VERIFY, O-107):
 *   TempSessionId  what the VIEWER minted and is waiting on. For a conference it is
 *                  session_id.generate() (llimview.cpp:2542) -- a fresh random id the server has
 *                  never seen. For a group it is the GROUP id (:2535-2538, "slam group session_id
 *                  to the group_id"). For P2P it is the XOR of the two agents.
 *   SessionId      the AUTHORITATIVE id the server assigns. The viewer adopts it only when a
 *                  ChatterBoxSessionStartReply arrives carrying {temp_session_id, session_id}: that
 *                  is what re-keys mId2SessionMap, updates the voice channel id and fires the queued
 *                  call (llimview.cpp:4877-4887 -> :1705-1737 -> :1731-1734). A session id in the
 *                  HTTP body is read by nobody, so the engine models BOTH ids and says when they differ.
 *
 * ROOM IDENTITY IS A THIRD THING (see NonSpatialRoomKey): the viewer treats channel_uri as opaque,
 * so the media room is NOT the session id. The live A2A path chose ChannelUri => SessionId.ToString()
 * (A2ASessionRegistry.cs:66); this engine deliberately does not repeat that.
