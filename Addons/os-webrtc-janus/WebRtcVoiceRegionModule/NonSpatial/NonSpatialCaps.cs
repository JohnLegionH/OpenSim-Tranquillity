/*
 * P1.1 item 5: the participant cap, RECONCILED with the mixer's rather than stacked on top of it.
 *
 * There is already a per-room ceiling and it is enforced where it has to be -- at the join, inside
 * the mixer: SLV_MAX_MIX (janus_slvoice.c:171-173, 110) refuses with JANUS_SLVOICE_ERROR_ROOM_FULL
 * (:112, 495), the connector keys on exactly that code (WebRtcJanusService.cs:50, :507) and maps it
 * to HTTP 409 Conflict (ProvisionResponseBuilder.cs:32), which the viewer reads as
 * ERROR_CHANNEL_FULL (llvoicewebrtc.cpp:3714-3716). That chain is the ground truth and this engine
 * does not duplicate it.
 *
 * What the engine adds is an EARLIER, SMALLER gate, and the reconciliation rule is:
 *
 *   1. The effective cap is min(requested, MixerRoomCap). A conference cap can only ever be at or
 *      below the mixer's, never above it, so the engine can never admit a seat the mixer will then
 *      refuse. If someone configures 500, they get 110, not a promise the mixer breaks.
 *   2. A refusal here produces the SAME observable as the mixer's: Capacity -> 409 -> the viewer's
 *      ERROR_CHANNEL_FULL. One failure mode reaches the user, not two that look different.
 *   3. The engine's gate is advisory-early, not authoritative: it refuses at accept, before a
 *      provision is attempted, so a 51st participant is told immediately instead of after a JSEP
 *      round trip. The mixer remains the last word, because only the mixer knows who is actually
 *      in the room.
 *
 * MixerRoomCap is a mirrored constant, deliberately: the module and the mixer are separate
 * artefacts with no shared header, and the codebase already mirrors the 495 literal the same way
 * with the same reasoning (WebRtcJanusService.cs:46-50). CapsAgree() is the assertion that keeps
 * the mirror honest and is unit-tested.
