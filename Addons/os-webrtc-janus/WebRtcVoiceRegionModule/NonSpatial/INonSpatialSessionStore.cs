/*
 * P1.1 item 7: THE GRID SEAM.
 *
 * This slice runs in-process, but nothing in the engine may assume that one region module instance
 * owns a session (O-110). The seam is here and nowhere else: the engine never touches a dictionary,
 * never holds a session between calls, and never reads a field outside a store operation. Every
 * mutation it performs is a single call to Mutate(), which the store executes atomically.
 *
 * WHY MUTATE() AND NOT GET-THEN-WRITE. A get-then-write engine cannot be made grid-wide without a
 * distributed lock, because two regions would read the same seat count and both admit the last
 * seat. Handing the store a delegate keeps the read-modify-write on ONE side of the seam: the
 * in-process store takes its lock; a future service implementation sends the intent and applies it
 * server-side. Every idempotency and cap race in item 6 is therefore decided in one place.
 *
 * WHERE P1.x PUTS THE SERVICE. WebRtcVoiceServerConnector is the existing region->service hop for
 * voice, so the grid-wide store is an INonSpatialSessionStore implementation that calls through it,
 * swapped in at module construction. The engine, the admission policies, the room-key derivation
 * and every test in this slice are untouched by that swap -- that is the point of the seam. What
 * that implementation must additionally carry, and this one does not, is written on each member of
 * the interface.
