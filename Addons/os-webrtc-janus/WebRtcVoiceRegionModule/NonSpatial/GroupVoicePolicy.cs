/*
 * P1.2G item 1 + item 6: who may be in a group voice room, and the opt-in knob.
 *
 * THE POWER IS THE GATE, NOT MEMBERSHIP. A group can have a role that may read chat but must not
 * speak, and the viewer already models that with two separate constants:
 *     GP_SESSION_JOIN  = 0x1 << 16   "can join session"   roles_constants.h:144
 *     GP_SESSION_VOICE = 0x1 << 27   "can hear/talk"      roles_constants.h:145
 * The slice specified GP_SESSION_JOIN. I require BOTH, and say so rather than doing it quietly:
 * requiring only JOIN would admit a member whose role has been explicitly denied voice, which is a
 * permission the grid owner has already expressed. Both live in `DefaultEveryonePowers`
 * (GroupsService.cs:44-52, `JoinChat | AllowVoiceChat`), so no ordinary group is affected; only a
 * group that has deliberately removed one of them is, and that is the point. If John wants JOIN
 * alone, RequireVoicePower flips to false and one test changes.
 *
 * OpenMetaverse's GroupPowers.JoinChat is 1<<16 and GroupPowers.AllowVoiceChat is 1<<27, the same
 * bits; the enum is asserted against the viewer's literals in the unit tests so a library change
 * cannot silently move the gate.
 *
 * ACROSS REGIONS AND HOSTS. The powers are NOT read from region-local state. IGroupsModule resolves
 * them through the groups service (local or remote connector), so the same answer is produced on any
 * region of the grid and on any host: a member's role powers are grid state, not scene state. That
 * is what lets the engine's session be grid-wide (O-110) without the admission becoming per-region.
 * The delegates below are the seam; the module supplies the real IGroupsModule and the tests supply
 * fakes.
