/*
 * A2a item 3: the CROSS-INSTANCE carrier for ad-hoc conference TEXT, and the resolution of the
 * carrier collision with the P1.2G-c ring.
 *
 * THE COLLISION. GroupVoiceRingTransport carries a ring as SessionSend + fromGroup=false, chosen
 * because no OnIncomingInstantMessage subscriber in the tree claims that combination (its header
 * enumerates all of them). Conference text needs to cross instances the same way and is ALSO
 * SessionSend + fromGroup=false, because it is the same free combination and for the same reason.
 * So dialog and fromGroup cannot tell a ring from a message, and a receiver that guessed would
 * either ring a viewer with somebody's chat line or swallow a chat line as a ring.
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR, AND WHY THIS ONE. A SEPARATE VERSIONED BUCKET HEADER, "LGVTEXT1", alongside
 * the ring's "LGVRING1" -- not a type field inside one shared carrier format. Three reasons, in
 * order of weight:
 *
 *   1. IT IS ENFORCED BY CODE THAT IS ALREADY LIVE AND ALREADY PROVEN. GroupVoiceRingTransport
 *      .TryParse requires the bucket to START WITH "LGVRING1" and returns false otherwise
 *      (GroupVoiceRingTransport.cs:96-105). A text message carrying "LGVTEXT1" is therefore
 *      rejected by the deployed ring parser WITHOUT ONE LINE OF CHANGE TO IT. The ring half of the
 *      discrimination needs no new code, so it cannot be broken by new code.
 *   2. A SHARED FORMAT WOULD MEAN EDITING THE RING PARSER. P1.2G-c is deployed and the ring is
 *      live-proven in-world (O-127); text is not. Putting a type field inside one format makes
 *      every text change a change to the ring's receive path. That trade is the wrong way round.
 *   3. THE RING'S OWN HEADER SAYS TO DO THIS. "Versioned so a future change of payload shape is a
 *      different header, not a silent misparse" (GroupVoiceRingTransport.cs:45-46). Text is a
 *      different payload shape. A new header is the documented answer, not an improvisation.
 *
 * The cost is two parsers instead of one. Accepted: each is ~20 lines, they share no state and no
 * enum, so neither can drift into the other, and each is ignorant of the other's magic -- which is
 * exactly what makes BOTH directions closed by construction rather than by a branch someone has to
 * keep correct. Tested both ways (a ring is not text, text is not a ring).
 *
 * ORDER OF DISPATCH DOES NOT MATTER and the module does not rely on one. The two magics are
 * distinct prefixes over the same byte range, so at most one parser can claim any given message.
 *
 * THE MAGIC NEVER REACHES A VIEWER. This is a module-to-module carrier only. The receiving instance
 * rebuilds a clean SessionSend for the viewer (AdhocTextSession.BuildForViewer), exactly as the
 * ring rebuilds its ChatterBoxInvitation locally, so a viewer cannot tell the local and the
 * cross-instance path apart.
