/*
 * A2b items 1 and 3: the viewer's chat-session LEAVE, and what "SessionAdd / SessionDrop" actually
 * turn out to be.
 *
 * THE FINDING THAT COLLAPSES TWO ITEMS INTO ONE. A2a listed SessionAdd/SessionDrop as unbuilt, and
 * A2b lists IM_SESSION_LEAVE separately. They are not separate. MEASURED by reflecting the real
 * enum out of the deployed OpenMetaverse.dll rather than trusting either name:
 *     SessionAdd           = 13     IM_SESSION_INVITE            (llinstantmessage.h:98)
 *     SessionOfflineAdd    = 14     IM_SESSION_P2P_INVITE        (:100)
 *     SessionGroupStart    = 15     IM_SESSION_GROUP_START       (:103)
 *     SessionCardlessStart = 16     IM_SESSION_CONFERENCE_START  (:106)
 *     SessionSend          = 17     IM_SESSION_SEND              (:109)
 *     SessionDrop          = 18     IM_SESSION_LEAVE             (:112)
 * So libomv's SessionDrop IS the viewer's IM_SESSION_LEAVE -- ONE dialog value, 18, under two
 * names. One handler serves both items, and building them separately would have produced two
 * handlers racing over the same message.
 *
 * SESSIONADD IS OUT OF SCOPE, WITH EVIDENCE RATHER THAN BY ASSERTION. Dialog 13 is
 * IM_SESSION_INVITE, and this viewer never SENDS it: every occurrence in the tree is a viewer-side
 * session TYPE, passed to gIMMgr->addSession or compared against session->mType
 * (exogroupmutelist.cpp:174, fsfloaterim.cpp:155/:1281/:2101/:2436, fsfloaterimcontainer.cpp:282,
 * llchiclet.cpp:706, llfloaterimsession.cpp:462, fsfloatervoicecontrols.cpp:241). Nothing packs it
 * into an outbound IM. A handler for it would be dead code, so there is none. The server-side way
 * into a conference stays the cap method "invite" (P1.4b) -- which is what the viewer does send.
 *
 * WHAT A CHAT LEAVE MUST NOT DO: touch the voice seat. O-108's three lifecycles are independent,
 * and this is lifecycle (1) alone. Before A2b the engine could only express a leave as
 * Depart(.., ChatLeave), which sets the member Departed and releases their seat -- so closing the
 * chat window would have hung up the call. NonSpatialVoiceSessionEngine.LeaveChat exists precisely
 * so that cannot happen, and the tests walk every combination of the three axes.
 *
 * WHY THE VIEWER SENDS THIS AT ALL: LLIMModel::sendLeaveSession packs IM_SESSION_LEAVE through
 * pack_instant_message + sendReliableMessage (llimview.cpp:2161-2180), reached from
 * LLIMMgr::leaveSession and from the group-mute path. It is UDP IM traffic, not the cap -- which is
 * why this is a client-IM handler and not another ChatSessionRequest method (O-108: "there is no
 * leave method on ChatSessionRequest").
