/*
 * P1.2G items 2, 3 and 5: admission for a GROUP provision.
 *
 * A group voice provision is indistinguishable from an A2A one at the wire: the viewer's group
 * channel goes through setNonSpatialChannel -> startAdHocSession (llvoicewebrtc.h:153-156), which
 * posts channel_type "multiagent" with `channel` set to whatever channel_uri it was handed
 * (llvoicewebrtc.cpp:1511, :3695). The discriminator is therefore the CHANNEL STRING, and that is
 * precisely what NonSpatialRoomKey's prefix was built to provide: a group room key is
 * "nsv1:group:<uuid>", which can never parse as a bare UUID and so can never be an A2A channel
 * (A2ASessionRegistry.TryGetByChannel is UUID.TryParse, :323-327).
 *
 * THE LIVE A2A PATH IS NOT EDITED. This is a wrapper: it takes the group arm only when group voice
 * is enabled AND the channel is one of our room keys, and otherwise calls
 * A2AProvisionAdmission.Decide with the same arguments it would have received anyway. That function
 * is byte-identical to its pre-slice self, which is how "provably unchanged" is met without an
 * argument about reading the code.
 *
 * DEFENCE IN DEPTH (item 3). The provision re-checks membership AND powers, it does not trust the
 * token alone. In A2A the token is held by exactly two named parties; in a group it is the same
 * string for everyone who can call, so a leaked token must not be sufficient. Order of refusal is
 * deliberate: no-session, then not-a-member, then no-power, then bad-token, then capacity -- each a
 * different operator problem and each its own greppable word.
 *
 * ROOM ALLOCATION (item 2) needs no code here. The room key IS the `channel`, so the existing
 * multiagent arm of JanusAudioBridge.CalcRoomNumber hashes (gridId, channel, "multiagent")
 * (:275-286) and produces a room number distinct from every parcel room and every A2A room. Nothing
 * in the Janus bridge changes.
