/*
 * A2a items 2 and 4: message fan-out for an AD-HOC conference, and who is allowed to send.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. Before A2a a typed conference line reached nothing: the viewer sends
 * ImprovedInstantMessage with dialog SessionSend and the conference's session id, and no subscriber
 * claimed it. InstantMessageModule drops it in its default arm (InstantMessageModule.cs:146-155 --
 * SessionSend is not in the five it forwards), and GroupsMessagingModule takes SessionSend only
 * for a GROUP id (its handler looks the id up as a group). So the line was dropped and logged.
 * O-111 filed exactly this: "there is no server-side ad-hoc conference TEXT session at all".
 *
 * GROUP TEXT IS NOT TOUCHED. This arm claims a SessionSend only when the engine holds its session
 * id as an ADHOC session. A group id is not in that store, so TryPlan returns false and
 * GroupsMessagingModule handles it exactly as it does today, byte for byte.
 *
 * THE MEMBERSHIP RULE (item 4) IS THE SESSION'S OWN SEAT LIST, not a roster and not a power.
 * An ad-hoc conference has no roster -- "being invited is the whole of the membership"
 * (AdhocVoiceInvite.cs:7-8) -- so the authority for who may speak is the same seat list that
 * AdhocAdmission.CanJoin reads and that AdhocVoiceInvite.Targets rings. Using the same list for
 * text as for voice and for ringing is the point: they cannot disagree about who is in the room.
 *   - the SENDER must hold a seat (Accepted or Present). Invited-but-not-accepted is NOT enough:
 *     someone who was rung and never answered is not in the conversation, and letting them type
 *     into it would make an invitation a write capability.
 *   - the RECIPIENTS are every OTHER seat holder. Invited, Declined and Departed get nothing.
 *
 * NO ECHO TO THE SENDER (item 4), AND THIS IS A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM THE GROUP PATTERN.
 * GroupsMessagingModule sends to self first of all (GroupsMessagingModule.cs:330-333) because a
 * group session's local echo is how the sender's own panel fills. A conference here does not want
 * that: the viewer already renders what it just sent into the ad-hoc session it owns, so echoing
 * would double every line. The prompt fixes this as a requirement; it is recorded here as a
 * KNOWN DIFFERENCE from the group path rather than an oversight, because the next person to read
 * both will otherwise "fix" it back.
 *
 * OFFLINE MEMBERS GET NOTHING STORED (item 5), and three independent things say so:
 *     OfflineMessageModule.cs:228-233        allowlist = MessageFromObject, MessageFromAgent,
 *                                            GroupNotice, GroupInvitation, InventoryOffered,
 *                                            TaskInventoryOffered -> anything else returns early
 *     OfflineIMRegionModule.cs:195-199       allowlist = the same minus TaskInventoryOffered
 *                                            -> anything else returns early
 * SessionSend (17) is in neither list, so an undelivered conference line is discarded rather than
 * stored, on whichever offline module a grid runs. We also set offline = 0 on the carrier
 * (AdhocTextTransport.Build) so the intent is stated at the source and does not depend on reading
 * two other modules to discover. This is the same finding P1.2G-c made for rings; it is re-checked
 * here rather than assumed, because the two modules' lists are not identical.
