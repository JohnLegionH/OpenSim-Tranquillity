/*
 * VisibilityBatchSender — orchestrates emission of the feeder's per-tick VisibilityBatch to the
 * mixer through an IPeerCtlBatchSink. Backend-agnostic (no Janus / no room number here — the sink
 * stamps the room). Driven off the VoiceVisibilityService tick via Pump(): fire-and-forget, never
 * awaited on the tick thread, never throws into it, single-flight.
 *
 * Emission paths (mixer-feed-protocol.md §3.2 / §3.3.1):
 *  - steady-state DELTA: <=1 add message + 1 remove message per tick (the bound is per-op §3.3.1);
 *  - SNAPSHOT (replace-all) on (re)connect / full-rebuild: sets _synced + _knownListeners, with
 *    clear-tracking — a listener dropped from Current gets an explicit empty replace, because op
 *    scoping is per-listener and omission is NOT a clear (§3.3.1);
 *  - per-listener JOIN replace (pending set): a DISTINCT path — it does NOT set _synced, NOT reset
 *    _knownListeners, NOT send the room. Triggered by WebRTC provisioning-success. Because the mixer
 *    silently drops a batch entry for a listener not yet in the room (:958) and exposes no admin
 *    room-membership query, this uses BOUNDED BLIND RE-SEND: the listener's replace re-sent once per
 *    tick up to PendingJoinMaxAttempts, then one loud give-up log (the silent-drop failure, made
 *    loud on our side). replace is listener-scoped + idempotent, so re-sends are safe.
 *
 * A ProtocolError from the sink is a config/format error (e.g. wrong AdminAPIToken / wrong plugin
 * name / broken transport in front). It latches emission off (per-region, cleared only by a service
 * rebuild / region-server restart) with one loud log — but only after ProtocolErrorLatchThreshold
 * CONSECUTIVE ProtocolErrors, not the first. Any Ok resets the run to zero; a persistent fault trips
 * all K within a second, while a lone transient stray-200 no longer permanently disables a region.
