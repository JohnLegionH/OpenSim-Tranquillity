/*
 * Console surface for the peer_ctl_batch sink's own counters (slice 0.6).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. JanusPeerCtlBatchSink has carried LastSendFallback* and LastSendStats since
 * slices S3b/S4, and its own doc comment said so plainly: "PLUMBING only -- read by nobody today;
 * surfaced for a future decision". The 0.6 shadow soak is that decision. The soak has to report the
 * sink's fallback counters, and a counter nothing can read is a counter the soak cannot report, so
 * this adds the minimal reader rather than leaving the pass condition quietly unmeasurable.
 *
 * STRICTLY READ-ONLY. It formats volatile ints already being maintained; it sends nothing, mutates
 * nothing, and cannot change the wire or the audio path. That is deliberate: it ships in the same
 * restart as [WebRtcVoice] VisibilityArmingEnabled=true, and a reader that cannot act is a reader
 * that cannot be a second candidate cause for anything the soak observes.
 *
 * Region scoping and the snapshot supplier follow VoiceModerationCommands exactly: a COPY of the
 * per-region map, never the live dictionary, because a console handler writes to a terminal and must
 * not do that while holding the lock the CAP handler and RegionLoaded contend for.
