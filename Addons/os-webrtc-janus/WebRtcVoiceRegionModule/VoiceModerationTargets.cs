/*
 * Pure target resolution for the voice-moderation console commands: turn the one token an
 * operator typed into exactly one muted agent, or into an honest refusal.
 *
 * Scene-free and console-free ON PURPOSE — the same reason LandBan and VoiceModerationAuth were
 * extracted. The interesting behaviour here is the ambiguity and absence handling, and that is
 * precisely the part that must be testable without standing up a region.
 *
 * The namespace this searches is the MODERATION STATE ITSELF, not the grid's user directory and
 * not the region's roster. That is deliberate and it is the whole point of the command: the muted
 * avatar has been removed from every roster the operator can click, so resolving against a roster
 * would reproduce the trap the command exists to escape. A grid-wide directory lookup was the
 * other option and was rejected: it can return a user who is not muted anywhere (silently doing
 * nothing), it cannot report ambiguity, and it needs a live user service the console may not have.
 * Resolving against the muted set instead makes both failure modes nameable and exact.
 *
 * The console MUTE (O-63 slice) reuses Resolve with a different candidate set - the region's root
 * avatars, since a mute is aimed at somebody still audible - plus the two pure pieces below: parsing
 * "<uuid-or-name> [parcel-local-id]" and choosing the parcel.
